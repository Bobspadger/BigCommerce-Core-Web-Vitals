# Simple example of using Bigcommerce HTML widget for images.

This is a simple HTML example to use on the home page of your site to add images etc without CLS issues.

Simply use the inbuilt Bigcommerce HTML widget and copy paste the code in - change the image links to those (using the CDN url's from image manager) of your own.

Its fairly simple to adjust to layout etc to suite your own needs.

Again, remember to set the image dimensions on the `<img>` tag - do not add in pixels!, and adjust the `loading=` and `fetchpriority=` attributes to match your needs.
