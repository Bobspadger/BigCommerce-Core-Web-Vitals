# Widgets.

These widgets are designed to give you a head start in creating useful widgets for your own store that don't break your core web vitals scores, aiming to improve your CLS and LCP performance.

They may have more options than you require, and some opinionated settings. This is due to the fact they have been developed in house for the company I work for to solve our needs. These may be things such as specific media queries, default quantities / links etc. Feel free to fork and adjust to suit your use case.
