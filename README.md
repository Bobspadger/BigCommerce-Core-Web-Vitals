# BigCommerce-Core-Web-Vitals
A repository of examples on how to improve BigCommerce core web vitals

## What is this repository?

This repository is a collection of examples on how to improve the Google core web vitals / page experience for Bigcommerce stores.

There will be a collection of sample code that can be modified to your own needs.


These examples are examples from my own experimentation, poking, prodding and a few crass words when working with BigCommerce at my company. You can see the real world output of these at [Absolute Music](https://www.absolutemusic.co.uk/), and possibly grab a nice new musical instrument while you are there ;-)


## Contributing

Feel free to submit pull requests etc for improvements, whether this is to improve the repository with performance, more generic use cases, documentation or just to add more Dog photos.


## Standing on the shoulders of Giants.

Its worth stressing that this work is really just an implementation of the incredible work done by Tony McCreath at [Web Site Advantage](https://bigcommerce.websiteadvantage.com.au/). I'd suggest going and reading his [blog posts](https://bigcommerce.websiteadvantage.com.au/tag-rocket/articles/) on the all the reasons why these widgets and code snippets exist.
